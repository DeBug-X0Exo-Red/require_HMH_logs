# c00lgui Reborn
a working version of c00lkidds old gui but remade it is lost on death tho so you will have to reexecute it and it can be laggy at times but can be fixed by dying to remove the gui if it does start to lag your game
```
:script require(14125553864):Fire("DeBug_UserName", "c00lkidd")
```
# Blast ss
a all-in-one software solution / software suite as it has both a serverside and clientside executor and more then 1 tab just in case with a output log, anti ban, script hidder for your executor, auto reopen when rejoining, server locker, R6 toggle, dummy spawner, respawner, hide/show button, and a script hub with 615 script as of now with the only problem being that it can be laggy when you move the gui but other then that its one of the best
```
require(5596373023).load("DeBug_UserName") 
```
# acgromatic glitcher
a personal favorite of Redactedre due to it being clean and simple not for most but it is nice for what it is and seemly rare the only problems is that people have reported lag when looking at it and sometimes using it and a few animations for the flying modes are buggy
```
require(5857033951).load("DeBug_UserName")
```
# IY serversided version
a serversided version of IY a useful admin tool but can be buggy at times and if you dont know what your doing you could get lost but other then that its ok
```
require(13716575182)("DeBug_UserName")
```
# topkek5.0
similar to Blast ss it is a all-in-one software solution / software suite but it comes with that said there are goods and bads of this 1 being it comes with no scripts it scripts menu is broken and does not have any script built into the tool but it makes up for that with a built in admin command system, a gear system and localplayer tools like rainbow name fly, god, permagod, appearance changer, freecam, team changer and more a executor, faces and server tools
```
require(0x342D5F0DA)("Redactedre")
```
